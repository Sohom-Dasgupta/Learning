# Machine Learning Models Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Models Repository! This repository serves as a collection of various machine learning models and projects that I am working on while learning about machine learning. Here, you'll find implementations of different algorithms, experiments, and insights gained throughout my learning journey.

## Introduction

This repository is a personal project aimed at exploring and understanding different machine learning techniques. It includes a variety of models, ranging from simple linear regression to more complex neural networks. Each model is accompanied by a brief description and code implementation.

## Models Included

- **Linear Regression**: A basic implementation of linear regression.
- **Logistic Regression**: Implementation for binary classification tasks.
- **Decision Trees**: Classification and regression trees.
- **Random Forests**: Ensemble method for both classification and regression.
- **Support Vector Machines**: SVM for classification tasks.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: KNN for classification and regression.
- **Neural Networks**: Basic neural networks using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: K-means, hierarchical clustering, etc.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA, t-SNE, etc.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
